# color-guessing-game
This game is 2nd task of my internship at MetaForte.In this game, we have to develop a color guessing game in which a user will be shown with a hex code of a color and 6 different colors. 
If the user clicks on the same color as hex code, he/she wins other wise he lose.
Only vanilla JavaScript is allowed, no jQuery. But bootstrap can be used in front-end
